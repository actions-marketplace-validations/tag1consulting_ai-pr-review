"""One short note that says what this review did not look at.

A reader sees "approved" or a list of findings. Without this note the reader
cannot tell a clean change from a change that was only partly reviewed. The note
lists three things that are known when the review starts:

- file patterns removed from the diff (lockfiles, vendor directories, and any
  user patterns),
- agents that did not run because their trigger did not fire, and
- an incremental review, which covers only the commits since the last review.

The note is plain text, built from names and patterns the tool itself holds.
It never contains text from the diff.
