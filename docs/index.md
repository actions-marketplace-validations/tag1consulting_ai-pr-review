## What it does

On every push to a pull request, AI PR Review runs a roster of LLM agents and deterministic static analyzers against the diff, then posts a structured review — a summary comment plus inline findings with "Apply suggestion" buttons where applicable. It's incremental (subsequent pushes only review what changed), suppresses known false positives via a JSON rules file, and is designed to fail gracefully when a model times out or a scanner is missing. Runs on GitHub Actions, Bitbucket Cloud Pipelines, or GitLab CI/CD against Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Quick start

Get AI reviews on your PRs in two steps:

**1. Add your LLM API key** as a repository secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or the equivalent for your [provider](configuration)).

**2. Create `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml`** with this minimal workflow:

```yaml
name: AI PR Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          
      - uses: tag1consulting/ai-pr-review/container-action@main
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          pr-number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          base-ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}
          head-sha: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

That's it — reviews start firing on the next PR.

## What's new in v2.19.0

**You can now leave the Walkthrough table out of the summary comment.** Set `suppress-walkthrough: 'true'` (the `AI_SUPPRESS_WALKTHROUGH` environment variable on Bitbucket and GitLab). The Summary text, Type and Effort stay. This is most useful on Bitbucket, which cannot collapse the table the way GitHub and GitLab do. The default is `false`, so nothing changes unless you set it. On Bitbucket a summary comment that already has a table loses it on the next run.

See [Version History → v2.19.0](version-history/v2.19.0) for details.

## What's new in v2.18.3

**Bitbucket error messages are clearer.** A failed Bitbucket call now shows the scopes the token has, so a missing-scope error is easy to fix. The warning for a failed account lookup depends on the HTTP status. A 401 means the credentials were rejected or the token has no scopes, and a 403 means the Account:Read scope is missing. The dismiss help line is no longer shown when that lookup failed, because verdict commands are off for that run.

See [Version History → v2.18.3](version-history/v2.18.3) for details.

## What's new in v2.18.2

**Bitbucket review comments are clearer.** The comment now has one "Summary" heading instead of two, the Code Insights note follows the findings list, and the headline shows both counts when some findings are outside the diff. If the Bitbucket account lookup fails, the run logs a warning and the comment says so. Add the Account:Read scope (`read:user:bitbucket`) to the API token to fix it, because without it the review posts a new summary comment on each push. Findings comments also link to the dismiss instructions, and an invalid `policy.yml` is now reported in the comment.

See [Version History → v2.18.2](version-history/v2.18.2) for details.

**Opt-in capabilities** — three independent features, all default off, all require the Python engine (the default since v1.0.0):

- [Tree-sitter context enrichment](configuration#opt-in-capabilities) — inject symbol definitions referenced in the diff into agent prompts; reduces hallucinated "should check X" findings
- [SARIF 2.1.0 ingestion](static-analyzers#sarif-ingestion) — merge findings from external scanners (CodeQL, Semgrep, Trivy, Bandit) into the same dedup/post pipeline as native analyzers
- [Learning loop](learning-loop) — reviewers post `/ai-pr-review false-positive | wont-fix | feedback` to persist verdicts to a dedicated git branch; future reviews see them as a `<repo-feedback>` block
